# Synveda

Enterprise memory & context management platform for AI agents.
Rust workspace + TypeScript adapters. Postgres-first. Governed by VedaFlow.

## Required reading (in order, before any task)
1. docs/SYNVEDA_SEED.md        — product principles & invariants (§2 is law)
2. docs/SYNVEDA_TECH_PLAN.md   — stack decisions & VedaFlow design
3. docs/SYNVEDA_FEATURES.md    — feature backlog; ALL work maps to a feature ID

## Working rules
- Every task references a feature ID (e.g. FND-1). Branch: feat/<ID>.
  Commit messages include the ID: "FND-1: scaffold rust workspace".
- A feature is done ONLY when its acceptance criteria in SYNVEDA_FEATURES.md pass,
  demonstrated by a test or a runnable demo script under demos/.
- Never create a code path that bypasses the PDP (seed §2.2), even in tests —
  use a test policy pack instead.
- Architectural choices get an ADR in docs/adr/ (copy 0000-template.md) BEFORE
  implementation.
- Crate dependency rule (tech plan §8): types ← {policy, store, identity, audit}
  ← retrieval/ingest ← gateway. Nothing imports upward. Adapters/SDKs depend only
  on the public API.
- Licences: MIT/Apache-2.0/PostgreSQL only in the core path. cargo-deny enforces.
- Prefer boring, explicit code over cleverness. This product sells trustworthiness.
- cargo fmt + clippy -D warnings must be clean before any commit.
- sqlx compile-time checked queries only; no string-built SQL, ever.

## Definition of done (every feature)
1. Acceptance criteria met and demonstrated
2. Tests written (unit + the AC test)
3. Tracing spans + metrics on new paths
4. Audit events emitted for any new action type
5. docs/backlog/STATUS.md updated

## Current phase
Phase 0 — Foundation (FND-1 .. FND-6). Do not start Phase 1 features until
FND is complete and `make dev-up && make smoke` passes.

## Commands (once FND-2 lands)
- make dev-up      — start Postgres(+pgvector+AGE+PGMQ), Rauthy, Temporal, TEI, Jaeger
- make smoke       — end-to-end health check
- make eval        — run the eval harness (EVAL-1+)
