# OPS-6: Upgrade and rollback discipline

**Epic:** OPS — Deployment & operations · **Phase:** 4 · **Size:** S

## Problem and evidence

The pre-1.0 epoch-3 hard cut intentionally refuses older databases and the
Helm gateway still upgrades with Recreate. There is no N-1 compatibility
window, production upgrade/rollback drill or application/database ordering
contract. [ADR-0069](../adr/adr-0069-schema-epoch-and-local-reset.md) governs
the current reset boundary; it is not a post-1.0 migration strategy. The gap
is tracked in [production readiness](../PRODUCTION_READINESS.md).

## Scope

- Define the first supported post-1.0 schema/application compatibility window.
- Require expand/backfill/contract sequencing where simultaneous N-1/N serving
  is promised, with bounded resumable backfills and preflight checks.
- Test installed-host and Helm upgrade, failure and rollback using production-
  shaped data and key custody.
- Refuse an incompatible binary before readiness or traffic.
- Record an explicit outage when a safe zero-downtime path is unavailable.

## Non-goals

- No compatibility shim or data translator for retired pre-1.0 epochs.
- No claim of zero downtime while OPS-7 keeps one gateway replica and Recreate.
- No rollback by reversing destructive SQL after it has removed information.
- No manual edits to the epoch baseline, SQLx cache or generated API contract.

## Architecture seam

Schema admission/migration retains administrative database authority; runtime
requests use the non-BYPASSRLS application role. Migration metadata, SQLx
queries, OpenAPI/client generation and release compatibility are one reviewed
change. Backfills use durable bounded state and do not hide authorisation or
tenant work behind application handlers.

## Acceptance criteria

- A declared N-1 dataset and key set upgrades to N without data, audit or
  tenant-isolation loss, and the supported mixed-version period is tested.
- Failure at every migration phase either resumes safely or restores through
  the measured OPS-5 procedure within the owner-approved window.
- Incompatible schema/binary pairs fail readiness before serving.
- Backfills are bounded, observable, idempotent and safe under interruption.
- Contract/SQLx/RLS checks pass before and after; any API change is versioned
  and generated.
- True zero-downtime acceptance includes rolling multi-replica traffic after
  OPS-7; until then the documented result is a measured maintenance window.

## Required tests

- Upgrade matrix for every supported N-1/N binary/schema pair.
- Failure injection before/after DDL, during backfill and before contract.
- Production-sized lock-duration, pool-pressure and request-latency tests.
- Backup restore and rollback rehearsal with audit-prefix verification.
- CI lint for migration ordering and prohibited destructive operations, kept
  small enough to produce actionable findings.

## Rollout and rollback

Canary on a restored copy, then one non-production deployment, then production.
Retain the previous binary and verified backup until the compatibility window
closes. Contract cleanup ships only after every old binary is excluded.
Rollback means run the still-compatible binary or restore; never fabricate
down-migrations for irreversible changes.

## Dependencies

OPS-5 is required for recovery; OPS-7 is required for a zero-request-downtime
claim. The owner must define the supported release window, outage budget,
minimum dataset for rehearsal and the date the pre-1.0 reset policy ends.
